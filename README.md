## Introduction

This website is designed to facilitate clients in monitoring their IoT devices produced by OWL. It serves as the client version of the [OWL Inventory](https://github.com/munovrizall/owl_inventory) website. The platform allows users to monitor device maintenance, view device specifications, and track the operational status of devices through the MQTT protocol. I worked on this project during my internship at PT. Origin Wiracipta Lestari in the Research and Development division for a duration of 2 months.
